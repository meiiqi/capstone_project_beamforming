# Capstone Project: Simulator for a Multi-Element Beamforming Phased Dipole Array Antenna's Radiation Pattern

### Jupyter Notebook Scripts for Modelling the Beamforming System and Plotting the Radiation Pattern (with Animation)

* [2D Polar Plot of Radiation Pattern](https://github.com/meiiqi/capstone_project_beamforming/blob/master/Beamforming%202D.ipynb)
* [2D Rectangular Plot of Radiation Pattern](https://github.com/meiiqi/capstone_project_beamforming/blob/master/Beamforming%202D_v2.ipynb)
* [3D Cross-Sectional Plot of Radiation Pattern](https://github.com/meiiqi/capstone_project_beamforming/blob/master/Beamforming%203D.ipynb)

### Matlab Scripts for Simulating the Beamforming System

_used the Antenna and Phased Array System Toolbox_
